## Visualization with Topic_wizard
Topic_wizard is a powerful tool to visualize topic clustering results for topic models. However, it cannot be applied directly to BERTopic models due to incompatibility. To address the problem, we modified the source code of topic_wizard to make it compatible with our BERTopic model (see `_topic_wizard_bertopic.py_`).

What's more, we adjusted the input to topic_wizard to make it display the Llama2 representation as topic name instead of the topic names originally generated by BERTopic.
